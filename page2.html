      <h3>Toxic Love 792x612px SJSU Art 74, 2018 </h3>
      <p>Toxic love is a Glitch art piece referencing the chemical waste problem we create and its connection to our drinkable water sources. The image is a mash up of a shot in my baker beach photoshoot combined with one of a crude oil refinery. The result was then opened to its code using a text editor and the code manipulated to create this glitch art portrait.</p>

      <p>Self-Titled beach is an image taken at one the bay areas ocean view locations. This chosen area is a infamous tourist attraction in the warmer seasons. The impact that traffic brings changes and disrupts the natural habits of oceanic life. This shift in habit is almost mirrored by the oceanic life during the colder season where the beach is all but devoid of people and multitudes of sea creatures can be observed on the beach. </p>

      <h3>Old Knowledge 4722x2828 Personal Work, 2017</h3>
      <p>Old Knowledge vs. new references the technological shift from paper to digital screens. Where books had been the source of passing and retrieving information for hundreds of years before, they are now replaced with internet enabled devices. These devices transcend the physical capabilities of books when it comes to manageable storage and  the devices are rapidly replacing other forms of information gathering. The image was taken in the basement of the SJSU library then altered in Adobe Lightroom</p>

      <h3>Have A Bite 4722x2829 DVC, ArtDM 2 2016</h3>
      <p>Have a bite is a study of photoshop and how to use its tools to create and effect of floating. The image used 4 images total to create the effect of a floating apple in the womanâ€™s hands. Using the technical skill of merging four images one for the top one for the bottom half and 2 high resolution photos of the apple combined with a bit of color adjustment create this illusion. Have A Bite was on of the first works I created in photoshop that I felt began my studys as a digital artist and one of the first that helped shape my skills with digital tools. </p>

      <h3>The Monkey King 960x540 SJSU Art 102, 2019</h3>
      <p>Using the Microsoft Kinect sensor, a scan of my body was taken to crate the pose for this render. Combined with some object creation using Maya this work references the Chinese tail of Son Goku the monkey king. It highlights the technical skill required to crate a model in Maya and the 3D printing software Cura to print a small model. The story of the monkey king was chosen because of the theme of playfulness and strength that the character has and how I see that same strength in motivation I use t create my work </p>

      <h3>Sound and Emotion 03:48 SJSU ART 75, 2018</h3>
      <p>Using projection mapping sound and emotion used the audio cues to evoke a feeling in the viewers. the video to cross the sound of struggle and joy crossed with the image of fire and water. The sounds are in flux with the imagery placing anger over the calming water and joy over the raging fire. The piece was projected on the ceiling for the art 755class to lay down on their backs in a completely calmed state to let emotion wash over them. </p>

      <h3>Scooby Finder 4:08 SJSU ART 75, 2018</h3>
      <p>Scooby Finder is a mash up of old 1970s through 1990 Scooby Doo Videos to make a theme of loss in the video. Using Adobe After Effects the videos were cut and stitched together in a way that heighted he narrative only created in the mashup. In it the gang loses Scooby early on and spends the better part of the 4 minutes searching for their lost dog, who is never too far away. Creating this piece for repetition and projection in a small intimate space creates and anxiety for the views. </p>

      <h3>Digital Rain 00:22 SJSU ART 101, 2019</h3>
      <p>For Digital Rain I used custom classes to make it rain. I also added a mouse pressed command to reverse the rain thinking it was part of the overall project. The objects are the rain itself and they are rectangles not lines. So when they turn under the command they actually turn around on the screen rather than just reverse. It shows off technical skills using processing, custom classes, object oriented programming and arrays to create a digital moving images</p>

      <h3>The Other Side 00:56 SJSU ART 75, 2018</h3>
      <p>The other side of the fence conceptually as about my feelings on the immigration struggle that has been a major topic of discussion in the past few years. We have this metropolis of a country and instead of sticking to its original good moral of bringing in immigrants and refugees we now erect barriers to keep people in need out. That face that is looping references the conversation with o real yes or no answer. He video was creeted with the use of after effects illustrator and Photoshop. </p>

      <h3>Building Batman 00:12 SJSU ART 101, 2019</h3>
      <p>Building batman is a piece that uses processing to capture the location of a pixel and it s color and changes it to a random shape and height to create the image of batman. The reference for this project started in ART 74 at SJSU and finished in Art 101. It uses processing and a image to plot color on the black background making a moving looping image of batman. </p>
