    <p class="w3-justify"> As a digital media artist my work center on the interconnectivity between people technology and nature. The process that helps me create these works is one of examinations where the focus is on the widespread effect of a topic all the while keeping the micro and macro in mind. I want to do more than just highlight the connection but focus the work on a point where the point of contact and impacts are felt by the viewer over their process. My media includes digital processes completed with the help of programs like Photoshop, Maya, Processing and Illustrator. The challenge I feel when creating a new space whether digital or physical is one that can be summed up with the question “how is this topic affecting more than itself.” Answering that question in the form of art not only connects me to the work but the work to the world.
    The ultimate goal of my artistic career is to help people look beyond their perspective. To push viewers to a point that may make them uncomfortable all in the name of growth in the fashion of acceptance. Digital art is an incredible medium for the exploration of life outside of the viewers means. Tools like A.R. and V.R. can literally put a person into a space that I the artist controls. With second hand skills in game theory and design I want to make the experience a path with different stimuli that appeal to a person's history and context all their own. My art is here to develop the perspective what the viewer gets from it is all their own. <p>
