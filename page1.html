    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Also known As Bryker </i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">As a digital media artist my works center on the interconnectivity between people technology and nature. The process that helps me create my works is one of examination where the focus is on the wide spread effect of a topic all the while keeping the micro and macro in mind. I want to do more than just highlight the connection but focus the work on a point where the point of contact and impacts are felt by the viewer over their process. My media includes digital processes completed with the help of programs like Photoshop, Maya, Processing and Illustrator. The challenge I feel when creating in a new space whether digital or physical is one that can be summed up with the question “how is this topic effecting more than itself.” Answering that question in the form of art not only connects me to the work but the work to the world. I biased a the span of my work on interconnectivity from the individuals point of view in a world where the power of a normal individual is either over justified or undervalued. This connection of how we as a people effects the world around us a how we can better communicate with it in a manner that is more symbiotic and less exclusive to lessen our impact. We control how this planet functions in a way that many cannot understand, from the food we grow to how we harvest and use our technology is a all a part of this ecosphere. My goal for my work is to bring this functioning system to the viewer in a way that doesn’t give them the answer, but it gives them a platform from which to see the overall view of the situation and develop their own opinions about the system and its functionality to its own life. <br>
I use digital media software and programming in a way that give a blank frame from which the reference is their own and the answer comes from an understanding of the community around the work. Maya, Premiere, Photoshop, illustrator, P5 and even coding are all media devices that I choose to employ in my creations. A digital media artist Is the title that I call myself and as the name suggest I will use any digital means to get my work viewed and interrupted by the ones who are in need. The ones who I feel are in need is every person that seeks out my work and uses the stimuli in a way that creates a visualization and change in their lives. Where the title” in need” comes from isn’t that of a financial need or a physical need like hunger or shelter but a need for change to a positive and a chance to do something better. My work views the interconnectivity on multiple levels and gives that dictation of a greater cycle to the people in needs in a call for change. The ultimate goal of my artistic career is to help people look beyond their perspective. To push viewers to a point that may make them uncomfortable all in the name of growth in the fashion of acceptance. Digital art is an incredible medium for the exploration of life outside of the viewers means. Tools like A.R. and V.R. can literally put a person into a space that I the artist controls. With second hand skills in game theory and design I want to make the experience a path with different stimuli that appeal to a person's history and context all their own. My art is here to develop the perspective what the viewer gets from it is all their own. <p>
